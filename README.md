# GAN-TL: Generative Adversarial Learning for Transfer Learning
This repository provides code for semi-supervised transfer learning between source and target domains using Generative Adversarial Learning. The code has been tested with multi-sensor, multi-temporal geospatial imagery with the goal of knowledge transfer between sensors, space and time. Please cite this paper if you use this work:
